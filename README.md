Welcome to the GitHub repository for the following publication: Genetics, energetics, and allostery in proteins with randomized cores and surfaces by Escobedo, Voigt, Faure and Lehner, Science 2025

Here you'll find the code to reproduce the figures and results from the computational analyses described in the paper.
All required processed files can be found in the related Zenodo entry. Raw NGS fastq files are available at Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO: GSE266299] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE266299)

The code is organized in Jupyter Notebooks, one per figure in the paper. To execute the code, please paste your path to the Zenodo files folder at the top of each notebook.
All Jupyter Notebooks can be executed using the BIO environment in the Environments folder. Other environments in the folder used for data processing as explained in the methods section.
